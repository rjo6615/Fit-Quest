# Fit Quest

## Description

This project was used to further our understanding and to utilize many of the tools we were taught in class. We used MongoDb, Express, React, and NodeJs for the stack. Then we used react-bootstrap,  mbd react ui kit, and bootstrap for styling. To try and create a website that can be used to help people on their fitness journey
